Objective:
The main goal of this dashboard is to present a 360-degree view of OLA‚Äôs business operations through powerful data storytelling. By integrating data from various sources and applying business intelligence techniques, this dashboard empowers stakeholders to identify operational bottlenecks, customer behavior patterns, and driver performance trends, all while maintaining a user-friendly and visually engaging layout.

Key Features and Components:
üìå 1. Executive Summary (Overall Ride Status & Business Metrics):
Displays high-level KPIs such as:

Total Bookings: 40,539

Total Booking Value: ‚Çπ14 Million

Successful Rides: 25,207 (62.18%)

Cancellation Rate: 37.82%

A pie chart breaks down ride statuses into:

Successful bookings

Customer cancellations (10.06%)

Driver cancellations (17.79%)

No drivers found (9.97%)

Helps management quickly assess the health of operations.

üìå 2. Revenue & Customer Segmentation:
Visualizations compare payment method preferences, with ‚ÄúCash‚Äù being the leading option, followed by digital modes like UPI and cards.

Highlights the top 5 customers by booking value, with a cumulative contribution of ‚Çπ19,505, useful for loyalty or retention programs.

Monthly trend of total distance traveled, which provides a gauge of fleet utilization and customer engagement.

üìå 3. In-depth Cancellation Analysis:
Cancellations broken into Customer-side and Driver-side reasons:

Customer Reasons: Change in plan, driver not moving, no contact with driver, etc.

Driver Reasons: Car issues, customer behavior, long-distance, duplicate booking, etc.

Represented using detailed pie charts and bar visuals, helping operations teams reduce friction points in future interactions.

üìå 4. Vehicle Type Performance Breakdown:
Analysis across different vehicle categories like Prime Sedan, Auto, Bike, and E-Bike:

Total bookings and successful bookings by vehicle type.

Average and total distance traveled.

Booking value comparisons for each category.

This analysis supports business optimization by identifying high-performing vehicle types and underutilized segments.

Tools Used: Power BI Desktop, Power Query Editor, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

Data Cleaning & Transformation: Performed in Power Query to format raw ride data into meaningful insights.

Interactive Features: Dynamic filters, slicers, and drill-down capabilities implemented for end-user flexibility.

DAX Measures: Custom KPIs created using DAX to calculate success rates, average distance, revenue per vehicle type, and cancellation reasons.

Business Value & Impact:
Operational Efficiency: Enables identification of frequent cancellation causes and poor-performing ride categories.

Customer Experience: Insights into customer preferences and common pain points help tailor service strategies.

Revenue Optimization: Data-driven decisions on which vehicle types and customer segments yield higher returns.

Strategic Planning: Helps OLA‚Äôs management align supply with demand, manage driver availability, and refine pricing strategies.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how Power BI can be leveraged to build a scalable and insightful business intelligence solution for the transportation industry. The dashboard not only provides clarity into current performance but also supports predictive and prescriptive analytics for continuous improvement. It serves as a practical example of how data visualization can transform raw data into actionable intelligence for enterprise-level decision-making.
